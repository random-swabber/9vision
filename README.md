# 9vision | a 9gag dashboard
Public data only. No log-in required.

The main point here is to use selenium to pilot a webrowser (Microsoft Edge) to scroll through a user profile on 9gag.com, and save data along the way, so we can display multiple vizualizations afterwards.
1. The scraping part is a notebook that will save data locally in a user-name folder at the time the script is manually executed. Won't update or fetch automatically.
2. The Streamlit part is accessing the previously collected data to display various vizualisation.
